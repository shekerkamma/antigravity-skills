# Antigravity / Gemini CLI Skills Repository

This repository contains a collection of example **Skills** for [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) and [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/). These examples demonstrate the "Agentic Command" pattern, where natural language requests are routed to specialized instructions, tools, and context.

## Antigravity Skills

Antigravity Skills allow you to define *how* an agent should behave, which tools it should use, and what context it should reference. This project breaks down skill development into 4 progressive levels of complexity.

### Skills in `skills_tutorial/`

The `skills_tutorial/` directory contains the following examples:

#### Level 1: Basic Routing
**`git-commit-formatter`**
* **Concept**: Pure prompt engineering.
* **Function**: Intercepts "commit" requests and formats the message according to the Conventional Commits specification.
* **Key File**: `SKILL.md`

#### Level 2: Asset Utilization
**`license-header-adder`**
* **Concept**: Loading static resources.
* **Function**: Adds a standard Apache 2.0 license header to source files by reading a template from the `resources/` folder.
* **Key Files**: `SKILL.md`, `resources/HEADER_TEMPLATE.txt`

#### Level 3: Few-Shot Learning
**`json-to-pydantic`**
* **Concept**: Learning by example.
* **Function**: Converts JSON data into Pydantic models by referencing a "golden example" pair (input JSON → output Python) instead of relying on complex instructions.
* **Key Files**: `SKILL.md`, `examples/`

#### Level 4: Tool Use & Validation
**`database-schema-validator`**
* **Concept**: Delegating to deterministic scripts.
* **Function**: Validates SQL schema files for safety and naming conventions by running a Python script, ensuring accurate results.
* **Key Files**: `SKILL.md`, `scripts/validate_schema.py`

### Usage

To use these skills in your Antigravity environment:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy the desired folders from `skills_tutorial/` into your workspace's `.agent/skills/` directory, or into your global `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` directory.
3. Restart your agent session.

## Gemini CLI Skills

### Skills in `gemini-cli-skills/`

The `gemini-cli-skills/` directory contains the following example:

#### Always Verify GCP
**`always-verify-gcp`**
* **Concept**: Validating GCP commands with the latest official documentation.
* **Function**: This skill interprets ambiguous Google Cloud commands by first consulting the official documentation via the Developer Knowledge MCP Server, then using the `ask_user` tool to provide a validated response.
* **Key File**: `SKILL.md`

## Claude Code Skills

Claude Code loads project skills from `.claude/skills`, the only skills a cloud session can see. Skills kept only in `~/.claude/skills` on your own machine stay local until you port them into the repo:

```bash
./port_cli_skills_to_repo_wsl.sh --dry-run   # list what would be copied
./port_cli_skills_to_repo_wsl.sh --push      # copy, commit on a new branch, push
```

The script resolves symlinks, drops `.git`, `node_modules`, virtualenvs, caches, `.env` and key files, and skips (and names) any skill that appears to contain a secret. It leaves a repo skill alone when it differs from your local copy unless you pass `--force`, and `--also-agents` mirrors the ported skills into `.agents/skills`.
